# 16-720B
Assignments for Computer Vision (16-720B) @CMU


All the assignments are solved using Python 3.6.5 (Anaconda Distribution)
If you are currently taking the 16-720B course, I encourage you to try the assignments on your own and preferably not use the code snippets here - since this is a violation of the academic integrity policy of the institute.

If you are here for learning different concepts, please go ahead and refer any snippets that you may not understand.

## Assignment 1 - Spatial Pyramidal Matching

Using kmeans clustering and spatial pyramidal matching for scene classification. Also testing vgg16 deep network with pytorch

## Assignment 2 - Feature Matching and Image Stitching

Using brief features and homorgraphies for image stitching. Also testing some basic theories of AR

## Assignment 3 - Lucas Kanade Tracking and Correlation Filters

Using LK with translation and affine warps, along with correlation filters for template matching.

## Assingment 4 - 3D Reconstruction

Using 3D geometry principles along with bundle adjustment for 3D reconstruction.
