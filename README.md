# 16-720B
Assignments for Computer Vision (16-720B) @CMU


All the assignments are solved using Python 3.6.5 (Anaconda Distribution)
If you are currently taking the 16-720B course, I encourage you to try the assignments on your own and preferably not use the code snippets here - since this is a violation of the academic integrity policy of the institute.

If you are here for learning different concepts, please go ahead and refer any snippets that you may not understand.
